Step A - Testing with Integers:
Before swap: a = 2, b = 4
After swap: a = 4, b = 2

Step B - Testing with Strings:
Before swap: a = Henry, b = James
After swap: a = James, b = Henry

Step C - Testing with struct (int, string):
Before swap: a = {1234, "Jim"} b = {9894, "Zelda"}
After swap: a = {9894, "Zelda"} b = {1234, "Jim"}
